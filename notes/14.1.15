to do as regards coding:
	- parameter bag
		- use a proto bag with non-template functions
		- use virtual functions and a general class type
		- combine double and uint parameter bags into a new big one
		- add primary and secondary parameter functions
		- write a program to print or change a parameter bag to inputs, basically to change the file so can be run from .sh files
	- argc and argv input
		- write a base class to take argc and argv inputs, check for "-" and do something, use virtual functions
		- write a class to take in parameters using "-name value"
		- write a class to take in -print options and -plot options
	- error class
		- base with just a message and printing
		- next with message and two doubles to compare
		- implement this
	- point class
	- lattice class
	- 2d eigen field class
		- use complex fields, its obviously better
		- use eigen functions in class
		- denote positions using points
		- get neighs facility
		- N and Nt as member data
	print function
		- first use << for as much stuff as possible
		- then overload a print function to get other more complex options
		- perhaps have one linked to the lattice so that you can print using simpleTime or simpleSpace
		- also want to print over ABC, ABCD, BC etc.
