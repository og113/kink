it is worth writing overloaded print and plot functions for vectors with a struct or something for options as there is too much faff at the moment about printing and plotting.
this can be written in a header and .cc file and compiled separately.
they should reduce the number of points for large vectors.
may want to pass simpleTime and simpleSpace functions
