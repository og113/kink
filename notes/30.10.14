to do:
main thing to check is the mode occupations and the linearisation:
	- rederive mode expansion in lattice for theta=0, to check sign
	- write linear energy i.e. in terms of the fields, separately to the spectral energy
	- check linearisation
	- plot these things
	- may need to remove high energy modes, potentially as artefacts of the lattice, check that results are independent of the cut off.
