to do:
matlab:
	done - quickly replace potFn with a mash up like on c++ program. epsilon=dE and a simple minima finder.
	done - write zero mode fixing to copy c++ program (just for one row, or 2, i think, we only need to compare the DDS, minusDS and p), chiX and chiT should also be the same as in c++ program.
	done - run pic and main to generate DDS for a case equivalent to c++ program output. need to make sure that input p is identical so should take in p from output c++ program. check alpha, etc.
	done - compare minusDS and DDS with c++ output.
	
c++:
	- after comparison with matlab - fix errors.
	- write code to do what potFn does in matlab. may want to write a whole program to do this. then could read epsilon, minima etc from a file.
	-may want to check time coord
	
	
	
	
	
agreement between matlab and c++
	- p input agrees
	- chiT agrees
	- chiX agrees
	- imag(minusDS) agrees
	- real(minusDS) agrees
	- DDS agrees to 1e-14
	- erg agrees to 1e-12
	- linErg doesn't agree, main.m is way out
	- linNum doesn't agree, main.m is way out
